<h2 id="#helpscorer">Help for scorers</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Results can be added without Login just with the number on the scoresheet. Select <em>Scorekeeper</em>
    from the left menu, then click on <em>Quick add result</em> and enter the game details.
  </li>
  <li>As a logged-in user you can find the games you are responsible for under <em>Game
      responsibilities</em> in the left menu.
  </li>
  <li>On the game responsibility page, you may select <em>Mass input</em> to input many results
    as one. Remember to press <em>Save</em> after changing results.
  <li>There are currently two different modes which may be more suitable for mobile devices: Try
    <em>Mobile Administration</em> or <em>Scorekeeper</em> on the left menu.
  </li>
  <li>If you want to input complete scorsheets, always start by setting the final result if it
    is not already set (via SMS or via mobile interface).</li>
  <li>Feed in player list according to paper score sheet:</li>
  <li>Feed in score sheet details.</li>
  <li>After feeding in all the details. Navigate to the <em>Played games</em> view and make sure
    the game result and game play view appear correct.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="#helpdivision">Help for division organizers</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You can use <em>Game responsibilites</em> just like scorers to input results.
  </li>
  <li>After pool is finished, teams need to "move" onto next pool before new results can be fed
    into system.</li>
  <li>Use the <em>standings</em> (or DIVISION <em>Pool standings</em>) in the left menu to
    authorize pool moves after pools are finished. (This is not always necessary.)
  </li>
  <li>Before you do that, make sure that all the results of previous pools are correct! Undoing
    moves or changing results later can be tricky.</li>
  <li>When all results are collected, go to the following pool and click <em>Confirm moves</em>.
  </li>
  <li>To undo moves,
    <ul>
      <li>first try clicking <em>Undo all</em>.
      </li>
      <li>If this doesn't work, you can manually remove teams from a pool by clicking on the red
        crosses next to the teams</li>
      <li>If this doesn't work, you may have to delete game results in the following pool first.
        Select <em>Games</em> from just below the pool standings table.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Alternatively you can go to the <em>Pools</em> view and select <em>Move teams</em> from
    there.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How to re-schedule?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the <em>Games</em> view.
  </li>
  <li>Click the tool icon on the line with the game.</li>
  <li>From the opening view you are able to change field and time of the game.</li>
  <li>You can enter a name for the game, e.&thinsp;g. "Game of the Day".</li>
</ol>
<p>
  If you have more than one game to re-schedule, open the scheduling view from the <em>Field
    reservations</em> or <em>Scheduling</em> link with relevant reservations selected if you have the
  necessary privileges (Scheduling right).
</p>
